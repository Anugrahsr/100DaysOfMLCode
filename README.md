# #100DaysOfMLCode
>Features my daily progress on the 100DaysOfMLCode challenge on Twitter!!

## Day 1
>>Completed learning the basics of few Data Science libraries namely numpy, pandas, matplotlib , seaborn and was successfully able to implement them with  a few exercises by Jose Portilla. From tomorrow i'm going to focus mainly on ML. Let's see how it goes :)

>>Ps : I was busy contributing on an Open Source Project (Cleanpy) (which you can check out in my repo) causing a slight delay in updating the status.
